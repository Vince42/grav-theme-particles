# Particles Theme
The **Particles** Theme is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).  This README.md file should be modified to describe the features, installation, configuration, and general usage of this theme.

## Description
The theme is based on Quark.

# Installation
<!--

Installing the Particles theme can be done in one of two ways. Our GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the theme with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file. 

The theme by itself is useful, but you may have an easier time getting up and running by installing a skeleton. The Particles theme can be found in both the [One-page](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-skeleton-onepage-site) and [Blog Site](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-skeleton-blog-site) which are self-contained repositories for a complete sites which include: sample content, configuration, theme, and plugins.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install particles

This will install the Particles theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/particles`.
-->
## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `particles`. You can find these files either on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vince42/grav-theme-particles)<!-- or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/themes)-->.

You should now have all the theme files under
